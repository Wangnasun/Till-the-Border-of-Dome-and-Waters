<h1>DAY3</h1>
<p>Dear Diary, I've been strolling through meadows and woods today. Guess what I found?</p>
<p>Yes, I like <a href="day3superstar.html" target="_blank">superstars</a>!</p>
    <p>I think they are awlsome.They have many fans but I am the different one. Because I just need two step from 
<a href="day3one.html" target="_blank">one</a>
to
<a href="day3another.html" target="_blank"> another one</a>
.But dont need something like <a href="day3airplane.html" target="_blank">airplane</a>.
Some guys are really wierd.</p>
<p>I almostly get lost in those forest. But lucky, when I go over tonight, I see <a href="DAY4/DAY4.html">something</a> hang on sky.</p>
